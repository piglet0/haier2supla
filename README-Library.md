# Haier2Supla Library Documentation

Haier2Supla is an Arduino library for ESP32 boards that integrates Haier air conditioners with SUPLA.

The library is built specifically for the Haier SmartAir2 UART protocol. It does not target other Haier protocol families. If your unit is not using SmartAir2, this library should not be treated as compatible.

## What This Library Does

The library provides two main layers:

- SmartAir2 communication with the indoor unit over UART
- SUPLA channel adapters that expose Haier AC functions as HVAC, relay, and sensor channels

The intent is to treat the air conditioner as a remote-controlled device. The AC unit keeps its own internal control logic, while the ESP32 reads current state and sends requested changes through the SmartAir2 interface.

## Dependencies

This library depends on the following components:

- ESP32 Arduino core
	Required for `HardwareSerial`, ESP32 runtime, and board support.

- HaierProtocol library
	Required for SmartAir2 packet handling and protocol-level communication with the AC unit.

- SUPLA device library
	Required for HVAC, relay, sensor, configuration, and web interface integration.

## Protocol Support

This library supports:

- Haier SmartAir2 protocol

This library does not support Hon protocol

## Main Components

- `HaierSmartair2Controller`
	Handles UART communication, state tracking, command sending, and SmartAir2-specific logic.

- `HaierSuplaChannels`
	Creates SUPLA channels based on sketch-defined level configuration and keeps them synchronized with the controller.

- `HaierSuplaStateSync`
	Synchronizes created channels with the latest AC state.

- `HaierAcHvacChannel`
	HVAC channel adapter used for target temperature and HVAC-related control.

- `HaierAcVirtualRelay` and related relay helpers
	Helper classes used to expose AC functions as SUPLA relay-style channels.

## Available Channels

All available channel identifiers are defined in `HaierSuplaChannelId`.

- `HorizontalSwingSensor`	- Horizontal Swing mode state
- `VerticalSwingSensor`		- Vertical Swing mode state

## Level Configuration

Channel exposure is defined in the sketch, not hardcoded in the library user API.

The library uses a single universal mechanism for assigning channels to levels.

### Universal Level Helper

Use:

- `makeHaierSuplaChannelConfig()`
- `setHaierSuplaChannelLevel(config, level, channels, count)`

This lets the sketch keep separate channel arrays per level while using one common API for configuration.

Example:

```cpp
static HaierSuplaChannelConfig buildHaierChannelConfig() {
	HaierSuplaChannelConfig config = makeHaierSuplaChannelConfig();

	setHaierSuplaChannelLevel(
			config, 1, kLevel1Channels,
			sizeof(kLevel1Channels) / sizeof(kLevel1Channels[0]));
	setHaierSuplaChannelLevel(
			config, 2, kLevel2Channels,
			sizeof(kLevel2Channels) / sizeof(kLevel2Channels[0]));
	setHaierSuplaChannelLevel(
			config, 3, kLevel3Channels,
			sizeof(kLevel3Channels) / sizeof(kLevel3Channels[0]));

	return config;
}
```

The helper supports flexible level numbers. The current implementation stores up to `8` configured levels in the configuration object.

The library itself can therefore handle additional levels such as `4`, `5`, and higher, as long as your sketch passes them into the configuration. Whether those levels are selectable from a web interface depends entirely on the sketch implementation.

## Channel Naming

Each `HaierSuplaChannelDefinition` contains:

- `HaierSuplaChannelId id`
- `const char *caption`

The `caption` is treated as a channel name suffix.

If `roomName` is set, the final caption becomes:

```text
<roomName>-<caption>
```

If `roomName` is empty:

- custom captions remain unchanged
- default library captions are generated without a leading `-`

## Examples

The library includes the following examples:

- `examples/Haier2Supla`
	The main reference application for full integration Haier SmartAir2 device to Supla device and broader project-specific configuration.

- `examples/ControllerOnly/`
	Minimal controller-only example without SUPLA channel configuration.

- `examples/ConfigurableLevels/`
	Full SUPLA example with web-configurable interface levels `1-3`. It also shows the universal level helper API.

- `examples/Level1Only/`
	Simplified SUPLA example that creates only level 1 channels and does not expose interface level selection in the web configuration.

## Installation

Copy the `Haier2Supla` directory into your Arduino `libraries` folder.

After installation, restart Arduino IDE if needed so the new library and examples are detected.
